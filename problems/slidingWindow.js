// Sliding Window:
// This pattern involves createing a whindow which can either be an arrau
// or number from one position to another

// Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
// Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string

// Divide and Conquer (used a lot in binary search)
// THis pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data
// This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity
